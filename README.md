### The input describes a single navigation problem. The first line gives a pair of real numbers, the X and Y coordinates where you’re currently located. The next line give the real-valued X and Y coordinates of the location you’d like to reach. This is followed by a line with an integer, n, the number of cannons available. The remaining n input lines each contain a pair of real values giving the X and Y coordinates for a cannon. All coordinates are measured in meters, and the value of X and Y will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
